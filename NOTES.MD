- Enabling global load balancing and traffic management.

## Q4: Differentiate between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) in Azure.

**A4:** 

IaaS:
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- Users manage OS, storage, and networking.
- Examples: Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage.

PaaS:
- Provides a platform for developers to build, run, and manage applications.
- Azure manages the underlying infrastructure.
- Users focus on application development.
- Examples: Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database.

Key difference: IaaS offers more control but requires more management, while PaaS abstracts infrastructure management for faster development.

## Q5: Describe the role of Azure in supporting hybrid cloud solutions.

**A5:** Azure supports hybrid cloud solutions by:

1. Providing Azure Stack for on-premises Azure services.
2. Offering Azure Arc for managing on-premises and multi-cloud resources.

## 3. Installing Linux on a Virtual Machine

Here's a step-by-step guide to installing Ubuntu Linux on VirtualBox:

1. **Download VirtualBox**: 
   - Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/ and download the appropriate version for your host OS.

2. **Download Ubuntu ISO**:
   - Visit https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop and download the latest LTS version.

3. **Create a New Virtual Machine**:
   - Open VirtualBox and click "New".
   - Name your VM, select "Linux" as the type, and "Ubuntu" as the version.
   - Allocate RAM (at least 2GB recommended).
   - Create a virtual hard disk (VDI, dynamically allocated, 20GB+).

4. **Configure VM Settings**:
   - Select your new VM and click "Settings".
   - Under "System", ensure boot order has hard disk first.
   - In "Storage", add the Ubuntu ISO to the virtual optical drive.

5. **Start the VM and Install Ubuntu**:
   - Start the VM and select "Install Ubuntu".
   - Choose language, keyboard layout, and installation type (usually "Normal installation").
   - Select "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" (this only affects the virtual disk).
   - Choose your time zone.
   - Create a user account and password.
   - Wait for the installation to complete and restart when prompted.

6. **First Boot and Login**:
   - The VM will restart. You may need to manually remove the installation media (in VirtualBox settings).
   - You'll see the GRUB bootloader, then the Ubuntu login screen.
   - Enter your username and password to log in.

7. **Post-Installation**:
   - Install VirtualBox Guest Additions for better performance and integration.
   - Update the system using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.

## 4. Role of the Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. Its main roles include:

1. **Memory Management**: Allocates and deallocates memory for processes.
2. **Process Management**: Schedules and manages running processes.
3. **Device Drivers**: Manages hardware devices and their interactions with the system.
4. **System Calls and Security**: Provides an interface between user space and hardware, enforcing security policies.
5. **File System**: Manages file storage and retrieval.

Comparison with other OS kernels:
- **Windows NT Kernel**: Closed-source, monolithic kernel with modular design.
- **macOS XNU Kernel**: Hybrid kernel combining features of monolithic and microkernel architectures.
- **Linux Kernel**: Monolithic kernel with loadable modules, offering a balance of performance and flexibility.

The Linux kernel's open-source nature allows for rapid development and adaptation to new hardware and use cases, contributing to its widespread adoption.
